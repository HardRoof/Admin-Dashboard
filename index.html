							<span class="card-tittle">Colter</span><br>
							After a failed robbery, the gang have fled from Blackwater into the Grizzly Mountains, but a late 
							spring storm has left them half frozen and starving. They hole up in an abandoned mining town to 
							lick their wounds and await a break in the weather.
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<span class="card-tittle">Horseshoe Overlook</span><br>
							After a break in the weather, the gang have headed down from the mountains, and are now hiding at Horseshoe Overlook. 
							They are outside Valentine, a muddy livestock town, and are figuring out their next moves while re-gathering their strength. 
							Dutch is trying to figure out a new plan for the gang. Some old friends reappear.
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<span class="card-tittle">Clemens Point</span><br>
							The gang got run of Valentine after an altercation with the railway magnate, Leviticus Cornwall. 
							Afraid that the routes westwards were being watched by Pinkerton agents, the gang moved south 
							and east and are now hiding at Clemens Cove, near the town of Rhodes. 
							Rhodes is in the grip of a feud between two old local families, the Grays and the Braithwaites.
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<span class="card-tittle">Shady Belle</span><br>
							Things ended poorly in Rhodes. The Pinkertons showed up again, and little Jack Marston is kidnapped. 
							The gang headed to Saint Denis hunting for Jack and are now hiding outside town, deep in the swamps, in a rundown old manor house called Shady 
							Belle. Dutch is desperately searching for an escape plan for them all. Hosea meanwhile is hunting a serious score for them.
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<span class="card-tittle">Guarma</span><br>
							A bank robbery in Saint Denis was a disaster. The gang has been almost destroyed, several members were killed and arrested. 
							Everything seemed lost.	Dutch, Micah, Javier, Bill and Arthur escaped on a boat. The boat sank in the Carribean and they were 
							washed ashore on the island of Guarma.
						</div>
						<div class="card">
							<span class="card-tittle">Beaver Hollow</span><br>
							The gang, or what is left of it were reunited at Lakay, but was quickly assaulted by a squad of Pinkertons. 
							The gang fled into some dangerous county to the north and are now hiding in Beaver Hollow, awaiting their fate and riddled with internal 
							disputes and anxieties. Arthur is not feeling very well and is unsure what to do.
